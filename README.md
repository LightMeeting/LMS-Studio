Matthew 18:20 "For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them."
This ongoing project is to develop an internet edge communication software for the Christian Community to have Bible Study and Fellowship online. The main idea is a decentralized Zoom-like meeting of an ultra-light host with a small number of multi-threading clients, and an intranet environment is set up among participants.
Bible Study: Bible versions of English(NIV) and Chinese(CUVS) are embedded. Other language versions might be supported in the future.
Fellowship: Up to 7 participants per party are supported, with stable communication of two or three parties, depending on the network speed, could support a small fellowship of 10-20 people. Communication is limited to audio, video and text-chatting. More stable participants might be supported in the future.
The latest software releases are English version(2.0.0) and Chinese version(2.0.1).
