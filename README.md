Matthew 18:20 "For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them."

This ongoing project is to develop an internet edge communication software for the Christian Community to have Bible Study and Fellowship online. The main idea is a decentralized Zoom-like meeting of an ultra-light host with a small number of multi-threading clients.

Bible Study: Bible versions of English(NIV) and Chinese(CUVS) are embedded. Other language versions might be supported in the future.

Fellowship: Up to 24 participants per party are supported, depending on the network speed, could support a small fellowship of 10-20 people with stable connection. Communication is limited to audio, video and text-chatting.

The latest software releases are English version(2.1.0) and Chinese version(2.1.1).
